# Progress Tracking

Maintain a progress file at `docs/PROGRESS.md`. Update it each time a task and its tests (if they exist) are completed.

**When to update**:
- After completing a task from the plan (`.cursor/plan.md`)
- After completing the corresponding acceptance/unit tests for that task
- Mark task as done only when both implementation and tests pass

**Format** (use checkboxes, number items as phase.task):
```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] 1.1 Set up project structure
  - [x] tests/unit/test_project_structure.py
- [ ] 1.2 Design universal metadata schema
  - [ ] tests/unit/test_schema.py
```

**Rules**:
- Add a task to PROGRESS.md when you start working on it
- Check off `[ ]` → `[x]` when task + tests are done
- If tests don't exist: create them first, then mark complete
- Include date and brief note for significant milestones (optional)
- After completing each task, add a manual verification section to `docs/VERIFICATION.md`
