# Internal Scripts Location

Scripts created for internal use (development, testing, automation, maintenance) must be placed in a dedicated folder.

**Folder**: `scripts/` at project root

**Examples**:
- `scripts/setup_dev.py` - development environment setup
- `scripts/seed_test_data.py` - test data generation
- `scripts/run_migrations.sh` - migration runner

**Do not** place internal scripts in:
- Project root
- `app/` or `src/` (application code)
- Scattered across the repo

**Exception**: One-off scripts in `scripts/` may use subfolders for organization (e.g. `scripts/etl/`, `scripts/connectors/`).
